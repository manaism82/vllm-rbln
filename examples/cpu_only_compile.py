"""CPU-only (NPU-less) compile example.

Run this on a host that has *no* RBLN NPU mounted -- e.g. a CI build worker --
to compile every graph ahead of time and write the ``.rbln`` artifacts to the
compile cache. A real NPU host can then reuse them via cache-hit and skip
compilation entirely at serving time.

How it works
------------
``VLLM_RBLN_COMPILE_ONLY=1`` makes the rbln ``torch.compile`` backend compile +
cache each graph while building its runtime on a *dummy* device, so no NPU is
required. It is a torch.compile option, so it only has meaning on the
vLLM-native model path; the optimum-rbln path is not torch.compile-based and
the flag conflicts with it. This example therefore also sets
``VLLM_RBLN_USE_VLLM_MODEL=1`` to run the vLLM model implementation (the
torch.compile pipeline). Three things follow from that:

* ``VLLM_RBLN_USE_VLLM_MODEL=1`` selects the torch.compile path where the
  ``compile_only`` option is injected at every compile site. Leaving it unset
  (the optimum-rbln path) makes ``VLLM_RBLN_COMPILE_ONLY=1`` raise an error.
* The compile cache must stay enabled (this is where the artifacts land), so
  ``VLLM_DISABLE_COMPILE_CACHE=1`` is rejected in this mode.
* Without an NPU, ``rebel.get_npu_name()`` returns ``None`` and the target NPU
  can no longer be auto-detected, so you must set ``RBLN_FORCE_NPU_NAME`` (e.g.
  ``RBLN-CA25``) to tell the compiler what to target.

The compiled runtime lives on a dummy device, so generation is intentionally
skipped here -- the only useful output of this run is the populated cache.

Usage
-----
    # Set the NPU you ultimately want to serve on, then run:
    RBLN_FORCE_NPU_NAME=RBLN-CA25 python examples/cpu_only_compile.py \
        --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B

The artifacts are written under ``$VLLM_CACHE_ROOT/rbln`` (default
``~/.cache/vllm/rbln``). Copy that directory to the NPU host (or share it via a
network mount) and serving there will hit the cache instead of recompiling.
