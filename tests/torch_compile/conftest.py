    # Running torch.compile-based tests in this tree leaves hundreds of
    # background threads alive in the pytest process (we saw ~2400 before
    # the EngineCore spawn). POSIX fork() clones only the calling thread
    # but copies every other thread's mutex into the child in its locked
    # state with no owner, so vLLM's default fork-based EngineCore spawn
    # deadlocks on the first inherited lock it touches. Force spawn for a
    # fresh interpreter in the child. Cost: ~seconds of extra startup per
    # EngineCore.
    #
    # Upstream vLLM forces spawn at conftest scope for similar hazards
    # (e.g. `tests/compile/fusions_e2e/conftest.py`, though their motivation
    # is subprocess-log capture, not thread deadlocks), and marks individual
    # compile-touching tests `@pytest.mark.forked` to isolate them. Tree-
    # level here (vs per-test) so new tests that instantiate an engine
    # don't silently reintroduce the hang.
