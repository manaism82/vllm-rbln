"""RBLN-specific NIXL metadata: pipeline-parallel (PP) extensions.

Isolated from upstream ``NixlAgentMetadata`` so the base struct and its
compatibility hash stay untouched. Both P and D are RBLN, so a private version
tag folded into the compat hash (``rbln_pp_compat_hash``) is enough to gate
PP-aware peers against mismatched ones. Under PP the producer advertises, per
(pp_rank, tp_rank) shard, the KV-cache layer names it owns; the consumer matches
each shard to its local regions by name (owned range derived locally, not sent).
