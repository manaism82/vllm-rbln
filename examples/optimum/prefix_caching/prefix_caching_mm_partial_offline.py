"""Prefix caching with a *partial* multimodal hit.

Each prompt is built as:

    [shared_image] [shared instruction] [unique_image] [shared question]

The leading ``[shared_image] + instruction`` is identical across every prompt, so
after the first request its KV cache is populated. On later requests that region
is a prefix-cache hit, and the shared image's vision-encoder run is skipped. The
``[unique_image]`` differs per prompt, so it is never cached and MUST still be
encoded on every request even though the earlier part of the prompt hit the cache.

This is the case the model runner must get right: ``total_cached_length > 0`` and
yet an uncached multimodal item remains after the cache boundary. ``_prepare_prefill``
encodes only the multimodal items whose placeholder tokens fall after the cached
prefix, so the shared image is dropped while the unique image is kept.

The question deliberately asks *only about the second (unique) image* and demands
a short answer. Two properties matter:

* Image-dependence: the answer depends on the uncached image's content, so if that
  image were wrongly dropped (or the cached one wrongly kept, misaligning the
  placeholder scatter), the answer would change and the assertion would fail. A
  general-knowledge question would pass even with the image dropped, testing
  nothing.
* Short + constrained output: reusing cached KV is not guaranteed to be
  bit-identical to recomputing it, so over a long free-form generation greedy
  decoding can diverge from the baseline even when the cache is correct. A short,
  low-entropy answer keeps the exact-match check robust to that numeric noise.
